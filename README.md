# github-workflows

Central repository for organization-wide GitHub Actions workflows enforced across all `hotdata-dev` repos via org rulesets.

## Workflows

### Claude PR Review

Automated code review on every pull request using [claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action). Reviews are severity-based:

- **P0/P1 issues** — requests changes with inline comments
- **P2/P3 issues** — approves with non-blocking suggestions
- **No issues** — silent approve

The review prompt lives in [`docs/claude-pr-review-prompt.md`](docs/claude-pr-review-prompt.md).

### Frontloaded review context

The workflow gathers the PR into the prompt before the reviewer starts: title and description,
commits, changed files with per-file line counts, CI check status with log excerpts from failing
jobs, the diff since the reviewer's own last review, the full diff, and the PR conversation.

This is not a convenience. The reviewer's allowlist is four `gh pr` commands plus `rg`, `Read`,
`Grep`, and `Glob`, and the checkout is `fetch-depth: 1` — so the reviewer cannot reach git history,
cannot run tests, and cannot pipe or redirect even the commands it is allowed. Before this, it spent
19.5 Bash calls and 5.2 permission denials per run trying anyway; 86% of runs hit at least one
denial, and one review approved a PR with the words "reviewed statically (test suite not run in this
environment)" while CI had already run those tests. Runs with no denials averaged 14 turns and 98
seconds against 37 turns and 270 seconds for runs with five or more.

Each block degrades to a sentence saying what is missing rather than to silence, because a reviewer
handed an empty CI block will state that CI is clean. The step is `continue-on-error`: a failure
there once skipped the review step and the notify step with it, leaving the PR with no review and no
explanation.

### Tool usage artifact

Each run attaches a `claude-tool-usage-pr-<number>` artifact (14-day retention): tool call counts,
Bash command labels with a compound flag, the denied subset of both, and the run's turn count and
cost. It exists to diagnose permission denials against the workflow's `--allowedTools` list, since
the job log records only the number of denials, never what was refused. Tool names alone proved
insufficient — 520 of 567 denials in the first week were `Bash`, which is every command there is.

The artifact is a projection of the action's execution log, never the log itself — that file is the
full conversation, and the runner holds a git credential the reviewer can read, which artifacts
(unlike job logs) would not mask. Command labels come from the fixed vocabulary in `CMD_JQ`, never
from the transcript, so no path, search pattern, or credential can ride along in a "command prefix".
`tests/tool-usage-test.sh` asserts that containment directly. Both the projection and the upload are
non-fatal.

## Setup

Requires:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` org secret
- [Claude Code GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) installed on the org
- Org ruleset pointing to this repo's workflow
